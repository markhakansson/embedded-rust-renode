# Embedded Rust & Renode

__WIP__

## About
This is my experimentation of simulating an embedded Rust program, for
the STM32 Nucleo-64 board, using the Renode framework.

## TODOs
- [ ] Create a small program to simulate.
- [ ] Create the board description in REPL.
- [ ] Create a script to automate all setup.
